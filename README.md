# Le Regard Maudit

This is a Next.js application generated by Firebase Studio, designed to visualize and track numerical IDs in real-time.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Google Maps API key.

You can get an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview). You will need to enable the "Maps JavaScript API".

```.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.
